		<!-- <h2>Finance Georgia</h2>
		<br/> -->
		 <h4>
		Finance Georgia is all about economic freedom. You get the unprecedented ability to invest in hot Georgia companies.
		</h4> 
		<p>Finance Georgia is an online marketplace that allows Georgia investors to buy shares of Georgia companies. Think of it as an "E-Trade for Georgia."
		<p>Potentially, this is your chance to invest in the next hot company before it gets publicly traded.
		<p>Georgia is consistently ranked as one of the hottest startup hubs in America, yet the funding for our companies comes primarily from Silicon Valley and New York. This takes money out of our local economy, and leads to some of our best innovators leaving the state. 
		<p>Entrepreneurship in Georgia is ranked at #9 in the country, thanks largely to a great university research system and the innovative companies creating services and technologies for the Center for Disease Control and the large number of Fortune 500 companies located in our state. 
		<p>The only ingredient for the perfect economic ecosystem is the lack of institutional funding. Thats where YOU come in. For the first time in America, everyday citizens can invest directly in the companies that are moving our community forward.
